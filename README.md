# Activity Generator

_Activity Generator_ is a mini web app built just for fun in React.js.

The app addresses problems ranging from _I'm bored_ to _I don't know what to do_.

The _Bored_ button generates a single activity, which on repeated clicks add up to a list. The _Reset_ button clears the page. The _Done!_ button clears individual tasks.

The _Activity Generator_ also includes a simple form where users can input their own ideas to add to the list.
